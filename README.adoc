# spring-boot-application-properties-unicode-with-bom

Spring Boot sample project to reproduce an issue when reading commented out application property.

The one test in `de.codecentric.demo.DemoApplicationTests` fails with

 org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<https://www.[codecentric.de]> but was:<https://www.[example.org]>

The `application.properties` in src/test/resources is of type

 $ file src/test/resources/application.properties 
 src/test/resources/application.properties: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text

Though the property is commented out in the file its value is read by the application.

When changing the `application.properties` to
 
 # de.codecentric.host=https://www.example.org

then the property value is correctly ignored.
I can even add a blank line as first line in this will - that works also.
